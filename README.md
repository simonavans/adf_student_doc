# Introduction to ESP-ADF
A guide that walks through the basic usages of the ESP-ADF framework. It is aimed at students on the Computer Science study at Avans, Netherlands with little to no experience with ESP-ADF and a basic understanding of the C programming language.
# Disclaimer
This guide is not meant to be, nor should it be used as, the single source of truth for ESP-ADF. Always do your own research on the topics explained here. Also, do not assume everything in this guide is correct, as I myself am still learning about ESP-ADF. Anyone is free to use any material from this guide. This guide will be updated for as long as I think it is needed and for as long as the current semester lasts.
# Motivation
This guide was made because of a lack of documentation about ESP-ADF. The [official documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-adf/en/latest/api-reference/index.html) does describe the basic building blocks for the framework, but lacks many code examples where they are demonstrated. Most of their documentation consists of individual function documentation, meaning developers need to figure out themselves if and when they should use them. There also seems to be no simple and complete enough guide on Brightspace (I don't think you're surprised), but [this presentation](https://brightspace.avans.nl/d2l/le/lessons/154524/topics/1206679) seems to be the most useful resource over there. Due to this, I've found myself struggling to understand the framework, and had to go back and forth between documentation and code examples to find out the real purpose of each function.

I expected that many students would have problems understanding ESP-ADF, given that many do not have much prior experience with C, ESP32 frameworks or even embedded software development as a whole. Students need a simpler, better documented and more complete guide to get them to understand the framework better. A link between documentation and code examples is essential to be included in such a guide. With all of this in mind, I decided to make this guide.

I'm willing to add collaborators to this project, so if you'd like to join, message me!
